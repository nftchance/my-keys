# My Keys

This project does not have a detailed README on purpose. If you would like to determine what is going on here I would recommend reading the code.

Usage of this tool is highly unethical. However, curiosity killed the cat and I felt even more unethical building this, and not open-sourcing it so here we are.

## Running

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
